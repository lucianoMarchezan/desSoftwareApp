# ExMAp (Experimentation Management App)

Empirical software engineering have been applying experiments for a long time as a form to empirically evaluating  a new proposal. The experiment planning and management is a important part of the research process. Thus, a system design to support those activities may be a effort and time reducing contribution. The Experimentation Management App (ExMAp) will be developed using JavaWeb and aims to cover all basic features of an experiment management tool.

This application is in development for software dev discipline for Software Engineering Master degree at Unipampa
